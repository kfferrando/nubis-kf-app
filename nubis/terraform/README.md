# Working with Terraform

## Set Up
Before you deploy with Terraform you need to set up your terraform.tfvars file. There is an example copy called terraform.tfvars-dist that you can copy and edit. It should look something like this:

```
account = "nubis-lab"
region  = "us-west-2"
environment = "stage"
service_name = "kf-app"
ami="ami-XXXX"
```

### account
This is the name for the AWS account you are intending to deploy to.

### region

The AWS region you wish to deploy to, like us-east-1 or us-west-2

### environment
The environment is one of *sandbox*, *stage* or *prod*. For this (and all manual deployments) you will set this to *sandbox*.

### service_name
The service_name is the name of this service. For Mozilla deployments this should be the name of a real service as noted in [inventory](https://inventory.mozilla.org/en-US/core/service/)

### ami
You will collect this as output from nubis-builder. Once the build is complete nubis-builder will display the ami id which you will need to manually copy into the terraform.tfvars file. You will need to do this after every successful build.

### ssh_key_file

Path to the public ssh key file you want authorized to ssh into the launched instances

### ssh_key_name

The account unique name you want to give to that ssh key

## Commands to work with Terraform
NOTE: All examples run from the nubis/terraform directory.

In these examples the service name is called *nubis-kf-app*. You will need to choose a unique service name for your deployment as their can only be one *nubis-kf-app* deployment at a time in one account.

### Get
Get and update dependent terraform modules

```
$> terraform get -update=true
```

### Plan
Preview the proposed change

```
$> terraform Plan
```

### Apply
Apply the proposed change
```
$> terraform apply
```

### Login
If you have only one EC2 instance and your ssh keys are on the jumphost, you can login by:
```bash
ssh -A -t ec2-user@jumphost.<env>.<region>.<account-name>.nubis.allizom.org "ssh -A -t ubuntu@<service_name>.service.consul
```

### Visit site
Terraform creates a route53 hosted zone and a cname record. And the resulting url will be part of the outputs:

```
Outputs:

  address = https://www.<service_name>-<env>.<env>.<region>.<account_name>.nubis.allizom.org/
```

### Delete
To delete the deployment:
```
$> terraform destroy
```
